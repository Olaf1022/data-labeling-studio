Unlike MobX itself, mobx-state-tree is very opinionated about how data should be structured and updated. This makes it possible to solve many common problems out of the box.
      Central in MST (mobx-state-tree) is the concept of a living tree. The tree consists of mutable, but strictly protected objects enriched with runtime type information. In other words, each tree has a shape (type information) and state (data). From this living tree, immutable, structurally shared, snapshots are automatically generated.`,
